        <p>"We began working with the team at Demly in 2021. They immediately and seamlessly integrated with our own internal marketing team, making collaboration fruitful. Our account was handled with dedication, passion and a clear, real investment. We had a fairly clear idea of our marketing requirements but wanted feedback, guidance and direction from our partner – and this was delivered by the Demly team on an ongoing basis. We were able to bounce ideas off each other, challenge each other and constantly evolve our activities. Air have really driven our marketing forwards and we’d highly recommend them as a partner.."</p>
